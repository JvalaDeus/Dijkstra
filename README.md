# Dijkstra
This assignment was to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm in java. 
My work contains three classes. First, there is the Graph class which creates the graph that Dijkstra's algorithm will run on. Next there 
is the Dijkstra class which is the code for the algorithm implementation. Finally, there is the testDijkstra class which actually runs 
the algorithm on the graph and outputs the shortest path from node A to every other node on the graph.
There are no noticable problems with my code.
I would like to thank my friend James Pederson for the help he provided me. When I showed him my code, it was quite a mess, cluttered and
messy. James helped me clean it up, name the variables to better names, and just overall organize my code. He also helped me fix a few
bugs with my code that gave the distance from A to non-connected code as infinity.
